            <p><strong>Dates:</strong> May 2024</p>
            <p><strong>Class:</strong> ECE484 - Final Project</p>
    
            <p class="project-overview">
                Successfully implemented an autonomous racing solution for the GRAIC competition using ROS (Robot Operating System) 
                and CARLA simulation environment. The project focused on advanced computer vision analysis, intelligent pathfinding, 
                and sophisticated obstacle avoidance systems, all while exceeding the minimum required lap time performance metrics.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Advanced Pathfinding and Optimization</h3>
            <p>
                Implemented RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Trees) pathfinding algorithm with custom optimizations for dynamic 
                racing environments. Enhanced the base algorithm with gradient descent optimization for waypoint generation, 
                resulting in an optimal racing line with minimal curvature. This innovation significantly improved cornering 
                speeds while maintaining the vehicle's agility for obstacle avoidance.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Intelligent Control Systems</h3>
            <p>
                Developed a sophisticated PID control loop with custom modifications for intelligent brake management. The system 
                implements light braking techniques rather than traditional aggressive braking approaches, allowing for:
                <ul>
                    <li>Enhanced momentum conservation through corners</li>
                    <li>Smoother transitions between waypoints</li>
                    <li>Improved overall vehicle stability</li>
                    <li>Superior lap times compared to standard implementations</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
    
            <h3>Computer Vision and Obstacle Management</h3>
            <p>
                Utilized Python to create a comprehensive computer vision system in ROS that handles:
                <ul>
                    <li>Real-time obstacle detection and tracking</li>
                    <li>Dynamic path adjustment based on environmental conditions</li>
                    <li>Predictive avoidance strategies for approaching corners</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
    
            <h3>Performance Results</h3>
            <p>
                The implemented solution successfully exceeded the competition's minimum lap time requirements while maintaining 
                robust obstacle avoidance capabilities. The optimization of the racing line through gradient descent, combined 
                with the sophisticated braking system, allowed the vehicle to maintain higher cornering speeds while remaining 
                responsive to dynamic obstacles.
